# Modeling real estate market in Budapest using Machine Learning
# Objective
An evergreen question, what is more favorable to buy a property or rent out a property and invest the rest of the capital.  
In this project I calculate the fair price of the real estates for sale and for rent in Budapest by leveraging machine learning algorithms. 
# Work in progress!
